What scripting language is Jenkins pipeline syntax based on?
Jenkins Pipeline syntax is based on Groovy, a dynamic, object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. 
Groovy provides a clean and expressive syntax that makes it easy to define complex pipelines. The Jenkinsfile, 
which is used to define a Jenkins Pipeline, is written in Groovy and follows a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) structure 
that is specifically designed for defining pipelines. This makes it easy for developers to get started with pipeline 
development, even if they have limited experience with Groovy or programming in general. The Groovy-based syntax provides 
a range of powerful features, such as loops, conditionals, and error handling, which can be used to create complex 
pipelines that can handle a wide range of scenarios and requirements. Additionally, because Jenkins is built on Java, 
developers can easily integrate their pipelines with other Java-based tools and services.
