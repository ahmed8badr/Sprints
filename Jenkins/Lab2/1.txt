What is Jenkins pipeline?
Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that provides a simple way to create, manage, 
and visualize continuous delivery pipelines in Jenkins. A pipeline is a series of steps that define a workflow for building,
testing, and deploying software. In Jenkins, a pipeline is defined using a special syntax called "Jenkinsfile" that is 
stored in the source code repository and executed by Jenkins as a part of the build process. 
The pipeline is defined using a series of steps that are executed in order, each step performing a specific task. 
For example, a pipeline might include steps to checkout code from a version control system, build the code, run tests,
and deploy the code to a production environment. The pipeline can be visualized in the Jenkins user interface, 
providing an overview of the build status and progress of each step. The pipeline is highly customizable, 
allowing developers to create pipelines that meet their specific needs, and Jenkins makes it easy to integrate with 
other tools and services, such as version control systems, test frameworks, and deployment tools.
