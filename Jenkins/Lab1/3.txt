Explain Jenkins master-slave architecture ?
Jenkins master-slave architecture is a distributed setup where the workload of building, testing, and deploying is divided between multiple machines. 
In this architecture, the Jenkins master coordinates the build process and delegates work to slave machines as necessary. 
The slave machines run the builds and send the results back to the master. 
This allows for better utilization of resources and improved scalability.
