what is different between authorization and authentication ? 
- Authentication in Jenkins is the process of verifying the identity of a user, to confirm that the user attempting to 
  access the system is who they claim to be. Jenkins supports several authentication methods, including basic authentication, 
  LDAP authentication, and OAuth authentication. Once a user has been authenticated, their identity is stored in the 
  Jenkins user database, and can be used to control access to various parts of the Jenkins system.

- Authorization in Jenkins is the process of granting or denying access to various parts of the system based on the 
  authenticated identity of the user. Jenkins supports several authorization methods, including Role-Based Access 
  Control (RBAC), matrix-based security, and project-based security. RBAC allows administrators to define roles with 
  specific permissions, and assign those roles to users or groups. Matrix-based security allows administrators to define 
  fine-grained access control based on user and project combinations. Project-based security allows administrators to define 
  access control for individual projects.

In summary, authentication in Jenkins verifies the identity of a user, while authorization in Jenkins controls access 
to various parts of the system based on the authenticated identity of the user.
