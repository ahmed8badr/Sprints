StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications, where each pod has a unique identity.
Deployments are used to manage stateless applications, where pods can be easily replaced. 
StatefulSets ensure that pods have a unique network identity, and maintain the same network identity across restarts and rescheduling. 
Deployments provide rolling updates and rollbacks.
